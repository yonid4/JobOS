# Job Application Automation System - Project Brief

## Overview
An automated system that discovers job opportunities, applies to suitable positions, and tracks applications in Google Sheets. The system aims to reduce manual effort in job searching while maintaining professional application standards.

## Objectives
### Primary Goals
- Automate job discovery from multiple job sites
- Automatically fill out and submit job applications
- Track all applications in a centralized Google Sheet
- Prevent duplicate applications to the same position
- Maintain high-quality, personalized applications

### Success Criteria
- Process 10-50 job applications per day
- Achieve 95%+ application submission success rate
- Reduce manual job application time by 80%
- Maintain organized tracking of all applications
- Zero duplicate applications to the same job

## Technical Requirements
### Core Components
1. **Web Scraping Engine**: Extract job listings from various sites
2. **Application Bot**: Automated form filling and submission
3. **Data Manager**: Handle application tracking and storage
4. **Configuration System**: Manage user preferences and criteria
5. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Track performance and success rates

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.9+
- **Web Automation**: Selenium WebDriver / Playwright
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
- **Database**: SQLite (local), Google Sheets API (tracking)
- **Configuration**: JSON/YAML files
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler
- **Logging**: Python logging module

### Integration Requirements
- Google Sheets API for application tracking
- Support for major job sites (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc.)
- Email notifications for application status
- Resume and cover letter customization

## Functional Requirements
### Job Discovery
- Scrape job listings from provided search URLs
- Filter jobs based on user-defined criteria
- Extract job details (title, company, location, description)
- Identify application URLs and requirements

### Application Process
- Navigate to job application pages
- Fill out application forms automatically
- Upload appropriate resume and cover letter
- Handle various form types and requirements
- Capture application confirmation

### Data Management
- Store job details in local database
- Log applications to Google Sheets
- Track application status and responses
- Prevent duplicate applications
- Generate progress reports

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Performance
- Process 1 job application per minute
- Handle 100+ job listings per scraping session
- Maintain 99% uptime during operation
- Respond to configuration changes within 5 minutes

### Reliability
- Graceful handling of website changes
- Automatic retry on transient failures
- Comprehensive error logging
- Recovery from interruptions

### Security
- Secure credential storage
- Encrypted sensitive data
- Safe handling of personal information
- Compliance with data protection standards

## Constraints & Considerations
### Technical Constraints
- Must respect website terms of service
- Implement rate limiting to avoid IP bans
- Handle dynamic content and JavaScript
- Work around anti-bot measures

### Legal/Ethical Considerations
- Comply with job site terms of service
- Maintain professional application quality
- Avoid spam-like behavior
- Respect employer expectations

### Resource Constraints
- Budget: $1,000-2,000 for development tools
- Timeline: 12 weeks for full implementation
- Maintenance: 5-10 hours per week ongoing

## Risk Assessment
### High-Risk Items

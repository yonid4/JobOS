# Active Context - Job Application Automation System

## Current Phase: Project Initiation
**Status**: Planning and Setup Phase  
**Start Date**: [Current Date]  
**Next Milestone**: Complete development environment setup

## Immediate Focus Areas
### This Week
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create initial project structure
- [ ] Research target job sites for scraping
- [ ] Set up Google Sheets API credentials
- [ ] Create basic configuration framework

### Next Week
- [ ] Implement basic web scraping for one job site
- [ ] Create job data models
- [ ] Set up local database schema
- [ ] Begin Google Sheets integration
- [ ] Implement basic logging system

## Technical Decisions Made
### Architecture Choices
- **Primary Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Web Automation**: Selenium WebDriver (can switch to Playwright if needed)
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage
- **Tracking**: Google Sheets API for application tracking
- **Configuration**: JSON files for settings

## Key Implementation Details
### Target Job Sites (Priority Order)
1. **Indeed** - Most common, simpler structure
2. **LinkedIn** - Complex but high-quality jobs
3. **Glassdoor** - Good for company research
4. **Monster** - Traditional job site
5. **ZipRecruiter** - Growing platform

### Application Data Schema
- Date Applied, Company, Position, Location
- Job Site, Job URL, Application Status
- Resume Used, Cover Letter Type, Notes

### Configuration Categories
- **Job Criteria**: Keywords, location, salary range
- **Application Settings**: Resume versions, cover letter templates
- **Scraping Settings**: Delays, user agents, limits
- **API Keys**: Google Sheets, email notifications

## Current Challenges
### Technical Challenges
- **Anti-Bot Measures**: Job sites implement CAPTCHAs and IP blocking
- **Dynamic Content**: Many sites use JavaScript for job listings
- **Form Variations**: Different application form structures per site

### Strategic Challenges
- **Quality vs Quantity**: Balancing automation speed with application quality
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensuring automation doesn't violate terms of service
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoiding multiple applications to same job

## Questions to Address
### Technical Questions
- Which web automation library provides best reliability?
- How to handle different authentication methods per site?
- What's the optimal scraping frequency to avoid detection?

### Business Questions
- What job criteria filters will provide best results?
- How to customize applications for different job types?
- What metrics should drive system optimization?

## Research Notes
### Job Site Analysis
- **Indeed**: Uses structured data, rate limits at ~50 requests/minute
- **LinkedIn**: Requires login, complex anti-bot measures
- **Glassdoor**: Good job details, moderate scraping difficulty

### Tool Evaluation
- **Selenium**: More stable, better documentation
- **Playwright**: Faster, better for modern sites
- **BeautifulSoup**: Good for static content parsing

## Blockers & Dependencies
### Current Blockers
- None identified yet

### External Dependencies
- Google Sheets API access
- Job site accessibility (no IP bans)
- Resume and cover letter templates

## Resources & References
### Documentation
- [Selenium Documentation](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
- [Google Sheets API Guide](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api)

### Code Examples
- Basic Selenium job scraper
- Google Sheets integration example
- Configuration management pattern

## Next Actions
1. **Immediate (Today)**: Set up Python environment and install dependencies
2. **This Week**: Create basic project structure and configuration system
3. **Next Week**: Implement first job site scraper (Indeed)
4. **Following Week**: Add Google Sheets integration and application tracking
